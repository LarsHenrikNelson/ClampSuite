Analysis methods
=====================
This guide goes through how each ClampSuite module analyzes the data. The intention is to
make ClampSuite less of a blackbox. There are several patch clamp electrophysiology analysis
program but many of these programs are either outdated or it is really unclear about how
they work. Understanding how your data is analyzed will also help you interpret your data
more effectively. I have noticed there is strong push for open source software likely due 
to the ease of using GitHub as a repository for software code.
