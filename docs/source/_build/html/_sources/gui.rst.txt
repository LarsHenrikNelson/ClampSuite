Basic GUI usage
================

Choosing the module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The GUI consists of four different modules: Mini analysis, oEPSC, current clamp and filtering. 
The specific module can be choosen by using the drop-down menu in the top left corner of the interface.

Loading acquisitions for analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each module features drag and drop loading. To drag and drop .mat files for first time analysis. Just select your files
and drag and drop onto the acquisition area of within each module.

Each module has three main buttons: Analyze acquisition(s), Final analysis and Reset analysis. Analyze acquisitions
analyzes the acquisition(s) after which you can go through and remove or modified specific parameters. The final analysis
button pulls all the data from each acquisition and puts into a table as well as averages data across epochs (1 cells
worth of data). Reset analysis clears all plots, data tables and acquisitions from the interface however settings are
not reset so one can quickly analyze several cells or even days worth of data at a time using the same settings.

The acquisition data is saved into JSON files since these files are portable and can be opened in most programming languages. The settings
are saved as YAML files. The final data in the tables are saved to excel files. It is recommended that you save each
analysis into a separate folder since it is easier to load the data back into ClampSuite.

Loading previously analyzed data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Data that has been previously analyzed can be load back into the program by dragging and dropping the folder into
ClampSuite. The folder can be dropped anywhere but the Acquisitions area where acquisitions are loaded.

Selecting display preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently none of the display preferences are saved. This is a work in progress. The colors
for the plots were chosen because they are colorblind friendly and stick out enough from both
the dark and light settings. You can checkout a program called Color Oracle to see what the program
looks like in when simulating different colorblindnesses.
